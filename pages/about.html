            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Coffee Vibes was founded in 2022 with a simple idea: serve great coffee in a place where people feel comfortable and welcome. What started as a small passion for espresso has grown into a space where quality, consistency, and good vibes come together.

We believe that great coffee starts with great ingredients. That’s why we carefully select our beans and prepare every drink with attention and care. From classic espresso to refreshing cold drinks, every cup is made to deliver rich flavor and balance.

But Coffee Vibes is more than just coffee. It’s a place to relax, study, meet friends, or take a break from a busy day. We focus on creating a calm and friendly atmosphere where everyone feels at home.

Our team is passionate about what they do and always happy to help you find the drink that fits your mood. Whether you’re a daily coffee lover or just stopping by for the first time, we’re here to make your experience enjoyable.</p>
